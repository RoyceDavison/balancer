# balancer
This is a simple budget tracking app. To access [**it**](https://balancer-roycez.herokuapp.com/). 
(The app still in development process to integrate more features, some previous features may be turn off for testing purpose.)

The app includes the following features:
1. Authentification: login with google email & logout
2. Add & remove & edit an expense(all expenses are stored in firebase)
3. Search for an expense
4. Reorder the expenses by amount or date

New features that will be integrated into the app:
1. Add signup page and allow more option to login using different social media
2. "Forget Password"
3. Classify the expenses, so users are easy to know their monthly spending
4. Add Fun APIs: food api that will be used to automatically calculate price for a meal and make meal recommendation to the users

In fact, I am more considering to make this app like cooking app which will show the receipt of a dish and automatically calculate the price for making this dish
with detailed integradient needed. 

To run the code you will need Node.js and NPM installed. First run the command:
```
npm install
npm run build:dev
npm run dev-server
```
