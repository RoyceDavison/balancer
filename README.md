This is a simple budget tracking app. The app includes the following features:
1. Authentification: login with google email & logout
2. Add & remove & edit an expense(all expenses are stored in firebase)
3. Search for an expense
4. Reorder the expenses by amount or date

New features that will be integrated into the app:
1. Add signup page and allow more login social media
2. "Forget Password"
3. Classify the expenses, so users are easy to know their monthly spending
4. Add Fun APIs: food api that will be used to automatically calculate price for a meal and make meal recommendation to the users

In fact, I am more considering to make this app like cooking app which will show the receipt of a dish and automatically calculate the price for making this dish
with detailed integradient needed. 

To run the code you will need Node.js and NPM installed. First run the command:
```
npm install
npm run build:dev
npm run dev-server
```
